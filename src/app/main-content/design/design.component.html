            <span>The application needs to be as simple as possible. Therefore, after launching it the first thing users will see is a chart showing their expenses for the current month. Underneath it there will be a set of three quick access buttons which will enable the user to add new expense, add new goal or view statistics. Main view will also consist of a small table showing latest transactions, with a “View All” button leading to transaction history search screen.</span>
